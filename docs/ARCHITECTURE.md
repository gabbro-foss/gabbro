# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A post-quantum password manager built with security as core DNA.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange → HKDF-SHA256 combiner → AES-256-GCM. Post-quantum: belt and suspenders.

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround). Full diagnosis in LEARNINGS.md.

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce, ML-KEM ciphertext, X25519 ephemeral pubkey) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text size, high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android (F-Droid + Play Store). Later: Windows. Android smoke-tested on GrapheneOS (2026-06-20): onboarding, vault sync, web autofill, l10n, settings all work — not yet exhaustive.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Play Store one-time payment is licence-compatible; F-Droid free build coexists without conflict.

**Version control:** private GitHub repo at https://github.com/Zabamund/gabbro. SSH auth.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 541 | 8 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 12 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch real settings or vault folders. All
config/data resolves through `GabbroPaths` (`lib/app_paths.dart`); `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
roots every `flutter test` in a throwaway temp sandbox, so even a non-isolating test reads
an empty registry and never reaches a real vault. Mirrors `rust/tests/fixtures/`.

## Current Focus

> Update at the end of each session. First thing to read at the start of the next.

### Next task: land granular sync

Granular sync is code-complete (see git log). To close it out:

1. **Add three hardware-walk procedures** to `test_data/sync_test_vaults/README.md`:
   - itemized post-sync summary (the **Details** dialog after a granular sync);
   - duplicate custom-field label rejected at save (editor check, any entry type);
   - cross-version sync (sync an older-format source — e.g. a `migration_vaults`
     vault — into a current vault; incoming entries merge without loss).
2. **Run all the hardware walks** on mock vaults (granular, fast, cancel/merge-rest,
   plus the three above). Must be green.
3. Gate: `gabbro_test` (~100min) must be green.
4. When the gate **and** the hardware walks are green, **merge `granular-sync-v9`
   into `master`**.
5. Then back to the **Bikeshed / Bugs** list.

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Bugs
- **Passphrase breakdown legend: "letter" row shows a CJK example.** The caseless-letter
  category (`_CharType.letter`, catches Lo/Lt/Lm) has a hard-coded example glyph `字`
  (`password_breakdown_sheet.dart` `_kExample`), shown in the legend even when the passphrase
  is Latin-only. Looks wrong / confusing. Pick a script-appropriate or neutral example, or
  hide the row when no caseless letters are present.
- **Enter does not submit the passphrase** (unlock + other screens) — cross-cutting; audit
  every passphrase/password field for an Enter-submit handler.
- **CRITICAL — biometric unlock rejects the correct passphrase (GrapheneOS, 2026-06-29).**
  Enabling biometric accepts the passphrase; unlocking *with* biometric then reports "wrong
  passphrase" while typing the same passphrase works. Vault NOT bricked. Branch changed no
  unlock source (only regen FFI) — suspect pre-existing / build-regen / stale AndroidKeyStore
  on reinstall. Investigate Kotlin `BiometricHelper`; may relate to the tablet item below.
- **JSON export hard-codes `gabbro version 1.0.0`.** Wrong and brittle (needs a bump
  every release). Fix to read the real version (single source: `pubspec.yaml`) or drop
  the field.
- **Linux: passphrase breakdown not shown.** Long-click on an unhidden (revealed)
  passphrase shows no breakdown sheet.
- **Detail view: entry fields not consistently ordered.** Different Gabbro instances on
  the same vault/entry show different field ordering.
- **Android tablet biometric toggle doesn't persist.** Fresh alpha.10 install on an
  Android tablet: enabling biometrics doesn't stick — after logout no biometric is
  offered. Not yet investigated.
- **DuckDuckGo browser autofill not working** (Android). Likely DDG blocking autofill
  modifications, not a Gabbro bug — probably WONTFIX/YAGNI; confirm before closing.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).
- Draft the free external crypto-review outreach (narrow ask: the construction only —
  hybrid combiner / transcript binding / header AAD / vault format). Vault format is now
  stable at VERSION 9, so this is no longer blocked. v1 direction in commit 9f158b5.

### Features & UX
- Autofill via `auto-type` (Linux/desktop) — global hotkey → foreground-window detection → synthesised keystrokes into another app (the KeePass/KeePassXC model, no browser extension). Needs a dedicated design session + ADR: Wayland blocks synthetic input outside the freedesktop RemoteDesktop portal / `libei` (KeePassXC's own auto-type is partial there), it's a new secret→input-subsystem security surface, and it cuts across "secrets live in Rust" (Rust holds the secret + synthesises input, Flutter registers the hotkey, per-platform window detection). Desktop-first; shares no code with Android autofill. Discuss-then-plan-or-drop.

### Code Quality
- **Autofill save loose ends.** Native review of the best-effort `eu`/`kk`/`yo` save-flow
  translations.
- KGP warning: `file_picker` and `url_launcher_android` apply Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) via the old per-plugin `buildscript` classpath pattern. Flutter warns this will become a hard build error in a future Flutter version. Both plugins are at their latest pub versions — fix must come from upstream. Monitor for `file_picker 12.x` and `url_launcher_android` releases that remove per-plugin KGP application.

### V2+ / Defer
- UI locales deferred (RTL layout work required): Hebrew, Kurdish.
- Passphrase wordlists — not viable without significant pipeline work: `yo` Yoruba (no frequency ordering, complex tonal diacritics); `sr_Latn` Serbian Latin (only Cyrillic corpora; needs transliteration pipeline); `lb` Luxembourgish (small speaker base); `wa` Walloon (nothing usable, French covers Wallonia).
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Vault sync across devices.
- Data breach alerts / HaveIBeenPwned integration.
- Panic button / app hiding on mobile.
- Remote app / vault deletion.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- *Broad* cross-layer integration scaffolding beyond the targeted hard-to-reach paths now in Current Focus (e.g. an exhaustive `integration_test/` × Rust `tests/` matrix). YAGNI: if users file bugs, those become the organic integration test suite.
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model (GitHub Sponsors + Liberapay + Monero — dedicated session near release).
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
