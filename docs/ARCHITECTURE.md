# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A quantum-resistant password manager.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange → HKDF-SHA256 combiner → AES-256-GCM. Quantum resistance from Argon2id + AES-256-GCM; the hybrid KEM layer is structural, not load-bearing (ADR-018).

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround).

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce, ML-KEM ciphertext, X25519 ephemeral pubkey) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text scale (`text_scale`, 0.8-8.0), high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android (F-Droid + Play Store). Later: Windows. Android smoke-tested on GrapheneOS (2026-06-20): onboarding, vault sync, web autofill, l10n, settings all work — not yet exhaustive.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Play Store one-time payment is licence-compatible; F-Droid free build coexists without conflict.

**Version control:** private GitHub repo at https://github.com/gabbro-foss/gabbro. SSH auth.

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch real settings or vault folders. All
config/data resolves through `GabbroPaths` (`lib/app_paths.dart`); `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
roots every `flutter test` in a throwaway temp sandbox, so even a non-isolating test reads
an empty registry and never reaches a real vault. Mirrors `rust/tests/fixtures/`.

## Current Focus

> Update at the end of each session. First thing to read at the start of the next.

### Next task

**Awaiting a RustCrypto Zulip reply.** Open question posted: can folding `ssA‖ssB` through
HKDF ever be *worse* than `HKDF(KM)`? (Sharpened draft in `docs/CRYPTO_REVIEW_QUESTION.md`,
local-only.) The CSE thread is closed — it settled the rest: the passphrase-derived hybrid
KEM is not load-bearing; PQ resistance = Argon2id + AES-256-GCM (ADR-018). Now leaning
toward dropping the layer pre-release — see Bikeshed > Code Quality.

## Build & Release

Build environment (Android/Kotlin/Java, SAF export) and full release process:
[BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

---

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).
- **RT-3 Release N+1 cleanup** (once no ≤v9 vault remains): delete legacy `StdRng` X25519 + legacy
  ML-KEM derivation + the frozen-golden tripwire; min supported version → v10 (≤v9 rejected gracefully,
  never bricked); convert the v2–9 gate fixtures to a graceful-rejection test; migration-vault + gate
  corpus floor → v10. Must ship Release N (v10 auto-migrate) first — see VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md.

### Going public (pre-v1)
- **Flip the repo to public.** Repo now lives in the `gabbro-foss` org (transferred; URLs
  migrated). Flip visibility to public once the pre-v1 gates clear (crypto-review outreach
  above is welcome-not-blocking). Optional: a read-only Codeberg mirror for redundancy.

### Code Quality
- **Drop the dual-lock (X25519 + ML-KEM) hybrid layer.** Demonstrably not load-bearing
  (ADR-018); adds nothing to security — Gabbro stays PQ-resistant on Argon2id + AES-256-GCM,
  and the mandatory-YubiKey premise that shaped it (ADR-005/006, superseded) is gone.
  `ml-kem` + `x25519-dalek` are used *only* here, so removal cuts the supply-chain surface
  from low to zero (drops both direct crates + ~6 unique transitive ones, incl. a
  compile-time proc-macro + build-dep). Touches vault format + code/tests/hardware/backward-
  compat, and the docs must be updated to match (ADR-018, SECURITY, README, ARCHITECTURE,
  crypto diagrams), so **pre-release if at all**, on a **separate branch**.
- **Auto-type: unlock-then-type + cold start (ADR-017 Phase 4).** A trigger while the
  vault is locked or Gabbro is closed does nothing today. Add: prompt-unlock-then-type,
  an opt-in setting, README key-binding examples, and package `gabbro-autotype` into the
  release bundle (update BUILD_AND_RELEASE). Secret stays in Rust; auto-lock preserved.
- **Autofill save loose ends.** Native review of the best-effort `eu`/`kk`/`yo` save-flow
  translations (and the `resizeColumns` label added the same way).
- **Native-review `aboutTagline` translations** (all locales, 2026-07-09 rename): `eu` Basque
  and `yo` Yoruba lowest confidence, `kk`/`lt` medium.
- KGP warning: `file_picker` and `url_launcher_android` apply Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) via the old per-plugin `buildscript` classpath pattern. Flutter warns this will become a hard build error in a future Flutter version. Both plugins are at their latest pub versions — fix must come from upstream. Monitor for `file_picker 12.x` and `url_launcher_android` releases that remove per-plugin KGP application.

### V2+ / Defer
- **Linux biometric unlock** (laptop fingerprint readers, e.g. libfido2/PAM or `fprintd`). Fits the current per-device model unchanged: Linux would just get its own local per-vault secret store; the vault file carries no biometric state, so nothing else changes.
- UI locales deferred (RTL layout work required): Hebrew, Kurdish.
- Passphrase wordlists — not viable without significant pipeline work: `yo` Yoruba (no frequency ordering, complex tonal diacritics); `sr_Latn` Serbian Latin (only Cyrillic corpora; needs transliteration pipeline); `lb` Luxembourgish (small speaker base); `wa` Walloon (nothing usable, French covers Wallonia).
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Vault sync across devices.
- Data breach alerts / HaveIBeenPwned integration.
- Panic button / app hiding on mobile.
- Remote app / vault deletion.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- *Broad* cross-layer integration scaffolding beyond the targeted hard-to-reach paths now in Current Focus (e.g. an exhaustive `integration_test/` × Rust `tests/` matrix). YAGNI: if users file bugs, those become the organic integration test suite.
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model (GitHub Sponsors + Liberapay + Monero — dedicated session near release).
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
