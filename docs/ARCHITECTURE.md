# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A quantum-resistant password manager.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM. Quantum resistance from Argon2id + AES-256-GCM (ADR-018). The vault key derives straight from the Argon2id output. The X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid layer was non-load-bearing and is gone: RT-3 deleted it with the `ml-kem` + `x25519-dalek` crates, and v11 is now the oldest readable format (≤v10 refused intact — see [VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md](VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md)).

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround).

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text scale (`text_scale`, 0.8-8.0), high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android, GrapheneOS. v2 maybe: Windows.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Every dependency licence must be GPL-3.0 compatible; the allow-list is `rust/deny.toml`, enforced by the `cargo deny` gate leg.

**Version control:** public GitHub repo at https://github.com/gabbro-foss/gabbro. SSH auth.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 641 | 17 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 11 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust crash-safety, kill mid-write (`cargo test --release --test crash_safety -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync-walk batched apply (`cargo test --release --lib sync_walk_batched_apply_matches_checker -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync merges a never-edited entry (`cargo test --release --lib sync_merges_a_never_edited_entry -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust cancel-sync + no-plaintext-leak (`cargo test --release --lib {cancel_sync_rolls_back_to_pre_sync_state,apply_sync_decisions_clears_backup_so_cancel_is_noop,sync_never_writes_plaintext_secret_to_disk} -- --ignored`) | 3 | 3 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust fast-merge walk (`cargo test --release --lib fast_merge_walk_incoming_wins_and_order_dependent -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Flutter (`flutter test`) | 1673 | 7 |
| Real-FFI suites (`dart test integration_test/ -j 1`) | 12 | 0 |
| Android (`./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`) | 148 | 15 |

**Real-FFI suites run under plain `dart test`, never `flutter drive` (non-negotiable):** they test
Dart -> FFI -> crypto -> disk, touch no UI, and so need no window. Needs the release cdylib (debug
Argon2id blows the timeouts) and `-j 1` (the Rust session is process-global; parallel suites clobber
each other). Under `flutter drive` they were blind (a failure exited 0) and crashed on a WM resize
— see LEARNINGS.md.

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch real settings or vault folders. All
config/data resolves through `GabbroPaths` (`lib/app_paths.dart`); `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
roots every `flutter test` in a throwaway temp sandbox, so even a non-isolating test reads
an empty registry and never reaches a real vault. Mirrors `rust/tests/fixtures/`.

**Known warnings — triaged 2026-07-16, no action. Gate stays green; don't re-diagnose.**

| Warning | Source | Why not fixed |
|---|---|---|
| Kotlin plugin version (2.0.21 vs 2.2.20) | Flutter SDK's own `:gradle` build | Upstream. Debug and release alike. |
| Gradle space-assignment x16 | pub-cache `jni`, `jni_flutter`, `file_picker` | Upstream. Hard error at Gradle 10. |
| JVM restricted-method (`System::load`) | Gradle 8.14 `native-platform` jar | Needs a wrapper bump — a full-gate change, do deliberately. |
| `cargo deny` no-license-field: `allo-isolate` | `flutter_rust_bridge` dep | Fixed on their master; await release. `[[licenses.clarify]]` is inert — don't retry. |
| `cargo deny` duplicates x6 | `argon2`->`digest`, `jni`->`libloading`, `bindgen`->`shlex` | Upstream pins. Was x7; RT-3 took the `hybrid-array` duplicate with `ml-kem`. The crate itself stays (`sha2`/`hkdf` -> `digest` need it). |
| KGP via `buildscript` classpath | `file_picker`, `url_launcher_android` | Upstream. Future Flutter hard error. |

## Current Focus

> Update at the end of each session. First thing to read at the start of the next.

### Next task

_(empty — v0.1.0-alpha.16 shipped; pick the next item from the Bikeshed with [maintainer].)_

---

## Build & Release

Build environment (Android/Kotlin/Java, SAF export) and full release process:
[BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Features and UI/UX
- **Final launcher logo (logo-blocked).** `render_icons.sh` renders a placeholder
  SVG. When the real logo lands, replace `assets/images/source/ic_launcher_light.svg`
  and re-run it; same render covers the Windows `.ico` (still the stock Flutter template).
- See if vault `syncing` can do without a second `passphrase + yubikey` if and only if the current vault and the incoming vault share the same `alias`, `passphrase`, `yubikey(s)`
- in `sync` path, we currently have `auto-merge` and `review all changes`, the `auto-merge` is additive only (check and verify) and therefore never deletes items in the receiving vault: (1) add a message that explains this (or the correct) behaviour to the user, (2) add a third `sync` mechanism that simply takes the incoming vault and clobbers the existing one - discuss this
- Investigate the idea of adding keyboard shortcuts
- **Publish on F-Droid.** Find the documented procedure to publish a package on F-Droid and see if we can publish Gabbro there.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).

### V2+ / Defer
- **Linux biometric unlock** (laptop fingerprint readers, e.g. libfido2/PAM or `fprintd`). Fits the current per-device model unchanged: Linux would just get its own local per-vault secret store; the vault file carries no biometric state, so nothing else changes.
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model: GitHub Sponsors is live; Monero possible later (a large, dedicated effort). Liberapay ruled out (2026-07-22 — Stripe forces business-type onboarding for individuals and has suspended Liberapay-linked accounts; no PayPal). Don't re-propose Liberapay.
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
