# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A post-quantum password manager built with security as core DNA.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange → HKDF-SHA256 combiner → AES-256-GCM. Post-quantum: belt and suspenders.

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround). Full diagnosis in LEARNINGS.md.

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce, ML-KEM ciphertext, X25519 ephemeral pubkey) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text size, high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android (F-Droid + Play Store). Later: Windows. Android smoke-tested on GrapheneOS (2026-06-20): onboarding, vault sync, web autofill, l10n, settings all work — not yet exhaustive.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Play Store one-time payment is licence-compatible; F-Droid free build coexists without conflict.

**Version control:** private GitHub repo at https://github.com/Zabamund/gabbro. SSH auth.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 541 | 8 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 12 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Flutter (`flutter test`) | 986 | 0 |
| Flutter integration (`flutter drive … -d linux --profile`) | 7 | 0 |
| Android (`./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`) | 140 | 15 |

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch the user's real settings or
vault folders. All config/data directories resolve through `GabbroPaths`
(`lib/app_paths.dart`), and `test/flutter_test_config.dart` roots every `flutter test`
run in a throwaway temp sandbox — so even a test that forgets to isolate itself reads an
empty registry and can never reach a real vault (wherever the user saved it). Mirrors the
`rust/tests/fixtures/` ethos of never operating on real data.

## Current Focus

> Update at the end of each session. First thing to read at the start of the next.

### Next task

**YubiKey onboarding can't mix transports.** Creating a YubiKey vault registers
both keys on one transport — you can't switch USB<->NFC mid-onboarding, so a
USB-only + NFC-only key pair can't both be enrolled at creation (found 2026-06-23
hardware matrix A2.1). Allow per-key transport choice during onboarding
(Linux + Android).

## Build & Release

Build-environment notes (Android/Kotlin/Java setup, SAF export) and the full
release process live in their own document:
[BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).
- Pin CI Actions to commit SHAs; add `cargo audit` + `osv-scanner --lockfile pubspec.lock` steps (once CI exists). See Track A Phase 1 audit in `AI_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.

### Code Quality
- **Autofill save loose ends.** Native review of the best-effort `eu`/`kk`/`yo` save-flow
  translations. (The no-match dialog was hardware-verified and is broken -> being fixed, see Current Focus.)
- KGP warning: `file_picker` and `url_launcher_android` apply Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) via the old per-plugin `buildscript` classpath pattern. Flutter warns this will become a hard build error in a future Flutter version. Both plugins are at their latest pub versions — fix must come from upstream. Monitor for `file_picker 12.x` and `url_launcher_android` releases that remove per-plugin KGP application.

### V2+ / Defer
- UI locales deferred (RTL layout work required): Hebrew, Arabic.
- Passphrase wordlists — not viable without significant pipeline work: `yo` Yoruba (no frequency ordering, complex tonal diacritics); `sr_Latn` Serbian Latin (only Cyrillic corpora; needs transliteration pipeline); `lb` Luxembourgish (small speaker base); `wa` Walloon (nothing usable, French covers Wallonia).
- Autofill via `auto-type` (Linux/desktop) — global hotkey → foreground-window detection → synthesised keystrokes into another app (the KeePass/KeePassXC model, no browser extension). Needs a dedicated design session + ADR: Wayland blocks synthetic input outside the freedesktop RemoteDesktop portal / `libei` (KeePassXC's own auto-type is partial there), it's a new secret→input-subsystem security surface, and it cuts across "secrets live in Rust" (Rust holds the secret + synthesises input, Flutter registers the hotkey, per-platform window detection). Desktop-first; shares no code with Android autofill. Discuss-then-plan-or-drop.
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Vault sync across devices.
- Data breach alerts / HaveIBeenPwned integration.
- Panic button / app hiding on mobile.
- Remote app / vault deletion.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- *Broad* cross-layer integration scaffolding beyond the targeted hard-to-reach paths now in Current Focus (e.g. an exhaustive `integration_test/` × Rust `tests/` matrix). YAGNI: if users file bugs, those become the organic integration test suite.
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model (GitHub Sponsors + Liberapay + Monero — dedicated session near release).
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
- Native app autofill matching by package name (v2).
