# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A quantum-resistant password manager.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM. Quantum resistance from Argon2id + AES-256-GCM (ADR-018). The vault key derives straight from the Argon2id output. The X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid layer was non-load-bearing and is gone: RT-3 deleted it with the `ml-kem` + `x25519-dalek` crates, and v11 is now the oldest readable format (≤v10 refused intact — see [VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md](VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md)).

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround).

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text scale (`text_scale`, 0.8-8.0), high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android, GrapheneOS. v2 maybe: Windows.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Every dependency licence must be GPL-3.0 compatible; the allow-list is `rust/deny.toml`, enforced by the `cargo deny` gate leg.

**Version control:** private GitHub repo at https://github.com/gabbro-foss/gabbro. SSH auth.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 634 | 17 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 11 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust crash-safety, kill mid-write (`cargo test --release --test crash_safety -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync-walk batched apply (`cargo test --release --lib sync_walk_batched_apply_matches_checker -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync merges a never-edited entry (`cargo test --release --lib sync_merges_a_never_edited_entry -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust cancel-sync + no-plaintext-leak (`cargo test --release --lib {cancel_sync_rolls_back_to_pre_sync_state,apply_sync_decisions_clears_backup_so_cancel_is_noop,sync_never_writes_plaintext_secret_to_disk} -- --ignored`) | 3 | 3 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust fast-merge walk (`cargo test --release --lib fast_merge_walk_incoming_wins_and_order_dependent -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Flutter (`flutter test`) | 1324 | 1 |
| Real-FFI suites (`dart test integration_test/ -j 1`) | 12 | 0 |
| Android (`./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`) | 148 | 15 |

**Real-FFI suites run under plain `dart test`, never `flutter drive` (non-negotiable):** they test
Dart -> FFI -> crypto -> disk, touch no UI, and so need no window. Needs the release cdylib (debug
Argon2id blows the timeouts) and `-j 1` (the Rust session is process-global; parallel suites clobber
each other). Under `flutter drive` they were blind (a failure exited 0) and crashed on a WM resize
— see LEARNINGS.md.

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch real settings or vault folders. All
config/data resolves through `GabbroPaths` (`lib/app_paths.dart`); `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
roots every `flutter test` in a throwaway temp sandbox, so even a non-isolating test reads
an empty registry and never reaches a real vault. Mirrors `rust/tests/fixtures/`.

**Known warnings — triaged 2026-07-16, no action. Gate stays green; don't re-diagnose.**

| Warning | Source | Why not fixed |
|---|---|---|
| Kotlin plugin version (2.0.21 vs 2.2.20) | Flutter SDK's own `:gradle` build | Upstream. Debug and release alike. |
| Gradle space-assignment x16 | pub-cache `jni`, `jni_flutter`, `file_picker` | Upstream. Hard error at Gradle 10. |
| JVM restricted-method (`System::load`) | Gradle 8.14 `native-platform` jar | Needs a wrapper bump — a full-gate change, do deliberately. |
| `cargo deny` no-license-field: `allo-isolate` | `flutter_rust_bridge` dep | Fixed on their master; await release. `[[licenses.clarify]]` is inert — don't retry. |
| `cargo deny` duplicates x6 | `argon2`->`digest`, `jni`->`libloading`, `bindgen`->`shlex` | Upstream pins. Was x7; RT-3 took the `hybrid-array` duplicate with `ml-kem`. The crate itself stays (`sha2`/`hkdf` -> `digest` need it). |
| KGP via `buildscript` classpath | `file_picker`, `url_launcher_android` | Upstream. Future Flutter hard error. |

### Next task

**Net for l10n + accessibility on every screen.**

**STATE 2026-07-19.** The overflow axis is built and covers every UI file:
`test/overflow_probe_test.dart` sweeps 33 of 35 screens+widgets on a phone and a
tablet surface at max text (2 waived — `yubikey_tap` and `section_index` render
nothing). Three guards protect it, each verified able to fail: pinned file counts,
a `_covers` cross-check so a declaration cannot stand in for a real probe entry,
and probe-or-waive over both `lib/screens/` and `lib/widgets/`. Flutter 1280 ->
1324 (+1 skipped).

**The behaviours still needing a net.** Each is what a user cannot do:
1. A string is missing in one language, so that user silently gets English.
2. A translation drops or renames a placeholder, so the message breaks.
3. Text fits in English but not in a longer language, so it is cut off.
4. An error from Rust appears in English whatever the language.
5. Dark mode or high contrast makes text unreadable, or the setting does nothing.
6. A control is too small to hit, or unlabelled so a screen reader cannot name it.

1 and 2 are checks on the ARB files, no rendering. 3 is the locale axis on the
probe — the loop level is all that is missing, one test per locale (chosen over
looping inside a test so a failure names the language). 4 lives in Rust.

**Measured, do not re-derive**
- The English sweep is 69 tests in ~4 s, so the locale axis is affordable.
- 34 selectable locales (`LanguageChoice` minus `system`).
- ARB key sets and placeholder tokens are identical across all 37 locales today
  (jq-verified) but nothing asserts either — both are cheap tests to add.
- Placeholder tokens stay ASCII in every script, so `\{(\w+)\}` matches inside
  Greek/Cyrillic/CJK messages.

**Traps**
- A child clipped inside a fixed-size box throws no exception, so the probe cannot
  see it. Of the three defects so far the probe found one (the tablet placeholder);
  the two clipping ones (recovery-history actions, sync_review chip values) came
  from hardware use and no test would have caught them.
- Probing a widget outside the conditions the app builds it in reports an overflow
  the user can never meet. The two-pane layout is gated at >= 600dp
  (`vault_list_screen.dart:1517`); swept at 360dp it "failed" as a harness artifact.
  `_tabletOnly` in the probe records the restriction.
- Sweeping locales inside one `testWidgets` needs the tree torn down between pumps
  (`pumpWidget(SizedBox())` first), or a stale overflow is blamed on the next locale
  — including `en`, which passes standalone. This produced a false defect report.
- An all-locale sweep must use `gabbroLocalizationsDelegates` (`main.dart`), not
  `AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates`. The raw list omits the English-fallback
  Material delegate, so nn/yo throw "No MaterialLocalizations found" and look like an
  app defect — they are not (RT3_CLEANUP.md:107). `test_helpers.dart`
  `testApp()` still uses the raw list.
- Collecting `tester.takeException()` filtered to `FlutterError` silently drops the
  "Multiple exceptions (N)" wrapper and reports a false green. Take any non-null.

**Not attempted:** the locale axis (item 3), the ARB checks (1 and 2), light/dark,
high-contrast, tap targets, screen reader labels, Rust-originated strings. Only the
English overflow axis exists. An earlier attempt built the locale axis and was
reverted — nothing of it is in the tree, so item 3 starts from the loop level.

## Build & Release

Build environment (Android/Kotlin/Java, SAF export) and full release process:
[BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Features and UI/UX
- See if vault `syncing` can do without a second `passphrase + yubikey` if and only if the current vault and the incoming vault share the same `alias`, `passphrase`, `yubikey(s)`
- in `sync` path, we currently have `auto-merge` and `review all changes`, the `auto-merge` is additive only (check and verify) and therefore never deletes items in the receiving vault: (1) add a message that explains this (or the correct) behaviour to the user, (2) add a third `sync` mechanism that simply takes the incoming vault and clobbers the existing one - discuss this
- Autotype in linux often has typos in the login/email. and it often fails perhaps due to a typo in the passphrase. investigate.
- **The other five importers still show raw Rust errors.** Enpass, Bitwarden, Google PM,
  Dashlane and CSV all set their error to `e.toString()`, so any Rust failure reaches the
  user untranslated. The Gabbro source was fixed (matrix 4.2 / 4.4); these were not.
- **Vault format version is meaningless to the user.** "v10"/"v11" is the file format and
  tracks neither the app version nor the alpha number. Checked 2026-07-18 — the too-OLD
  path is already fixed: unlock and Gabbro-source import probe `vaultFormatTooOld()` and
  show `vaultFormatTooOld` + the upgrade link, naming no number, clean in all locales.
  Two raw Rust strings still leak it, both English-only:
  - `file_format.rs:264` (too old) — surfaces only where the raw error is shown instead of
    the probe, i.e. the five importers above; fixing those covers it.
  - `file_format.rs:255` (too NEW) — **the real gap.** No `vaultFormatTooNew` ARB string
    exists at all, so a vault written by a newer build gives an untranslated message citing
    a meaningless number. Reachable by syncing between devices on different versions.
    Needs a new localized string + a probe, mirroring the too-old path.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).

### Going public (pre-v1)
- **Flip the repo to public.** Repo now lives in the `gabbro-foss` org (transferred; URLs
  migrated). Flip visibility to public once the pre-v1 gates clear (crypto-review outreach
  above is welcome-not-blocking). Optional: a read-only Codeberg mirror for redundancy.

### Code Quality
- **Linux ships no desktop icon.** No `.desktop` file and no hicolor icon tree, so an
  installed build (AUR) shows a generic placeholder in the app menu and taskbar. Render
  16/32/48/64/128/256/512 plus a scalable SVG from `ic_launcher_*.svg` and add a `.desktop`
  entry. Blocked on the new logo. Same render covers the Windows `.ico`, still the stock
  Flutter template.
- **Auto-type: unlock-then-type + cold start (ADR-017 Phase 4).** A trigger while the
  vault is locked or Gabbro is closed does nothing today. Add: prompt-unlock-then-type
  and an opt-in setting. Secret stays in Rust; auto-lock preserved.

### V2+ / Defer
- **Linux biometric unlock** (laptop fingerprint readers, e.g. libfido2/PAM or `fprintd`). Fits the current per-device model unchanged: Linux would just get its own local per-vault secret store; the vault file carries no biometric state, so nothing else changes.
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model (GitHub Sponsors + Liberapay + Monero — dedicated session near release).
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
