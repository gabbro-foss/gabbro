# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A quantum-resistant password manager.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** all keys and cryptography live in Rust; the vault is decrypted there and the master keys never cross the bridge. Secrets the user actively views, generates, or autofills do reach Flutter in plaintext to be displayed (bounded by auto-lock; the Dart heap retains them until GC — see SECURITY.md / audit F-12) — the keys never do.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM. Quantum resistance from Argon2id + AES-256-GCM (ADR-018). The vault key derives straight from the Argon2id output. The X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid layer was non-load-bearing and is gone: RT-3 deleted it with the `ml-kem` + `x25519-dalek` crates, and v11 is now the oldest readable format (≤v10 refused intact — see [VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md](VAULT_UPGRADE_PATH.md)).

**Authentication (app access):** Passphrase always; a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey) is strongly recommended but **not enforced** — a passphrase-only vault is the default. When keys are used: v1 Ed25519 (hardware constraint), target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005), min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround).

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text scale (`text_scale`, 0.8-8.0), high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Keyboard shortcuts (Linux desktop):** Ctrl+L lock, Ctrl+F / Ctrl+Shift+F search, Ctrl+N new entry, Ctrl+M menu, Ctrl+Q lock and quit (confirms first), Esc dismiss/cancel. No Ctrl+C (copying a secret stays a deliberate, auto-clearing action); no Super key. Listed in-app on the desktop-only Keyboard shortcuts screen.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android, GrapheneOS. v2 maybe: Windows.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Every dependency licence must be GPL-3.0 compatible; the allow-list is `rust/deny.toml`, enforced by the `cargo deny` gate leg.

**Version control:** public GitHub repo at https://github.com/gabbro-foss/gabbro. SSH auth.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 641 | 17 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 11 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust crash-safety, kill mid-write (`cargo test --release --test crash_safety -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync-walk batched apply (`cargo test --release --lib sync_walk_batched_apply_matches_checker -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust sync merges a never-edited entry (`cargo test --release --lib sync_merges_a_never_edited_entry -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust cancel-sync + no-plaintext-leak (`cargo test --release --lib {cancel_sync_rolls_back_to_pre_sync_state,apply_sync_decisions_clears_backup_so_cancel_is_noop,sync_never_writes_plaintext_secret_to_disk} -- --ignored`) | 3 | 3 (opt-in by default) |
| Rust fast-merge walk (`cargo test --release --lib fast_merge_walk_incoming_wins_and_order_dependent -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Flutter (`flutter test`) | 1972 | 10 |
| Real-FFI suites (`dart test integration_test/ -j 1`) | 12 | 0 |
| Android (`./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`) | 148 | 15 |

**Real-FFI suites run under plain `dart test`, never `flutter drive` (non-negotiable):** they test
Dart -> FFI -> crypto -> disk, touch no UI, and so need no window. Needs the release cdylib (debug
Argon2id blows the timeouts) and `-j 1` (the Rust session is process-global; parallel suites clobber
each other). Under `flutter drive` they were blind (a failure exited 0) and crashed on a WM resize
— see LEARNINGS.md.

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch real settings or vault folders. All
config/data resolves through `GabbroPaths` (`lib/app_paths.dart`); `test/flutter_test_config.dart`
roots every `flutter test` in a throwaway temp sandbox, so even a non-isolating test reads
an empty registry and never reaches a real vault. Mirrors `rust/tests/fixtures/`.

**Known warnings — triaged 2026-07-16, no action. Gate stays green; don't re-diagnose.**

| Warning | Source | Why not fixed |
|---|---|---|
| Kotlin plugin version (2.0.21 vs 2.2.20) | Flutter SDK's own `:gradle` build | Upstream. Debug and release alike. |
| Gradle space-assignment x16 | pub-cache `jni`, `jni_flutter`, `file_picker` | Upstream. Hard error at Gradle 10. |
| JVM restricted-method (`System::load`) | Gradle 8.14 `native-platform` jar | Needs a wrapper bump — a full-gate change, do deliberately. |
| `cargo deny` no-license-field: `allo-isolate` | `flutter_rust_bridge` dep | Fixed on their master; await release. `[[licenses.clarify]]` is inert — don't retry. |
| `cargo deny` duplicates x6 | `argon2`->`digest`, `jni`->`libloading`, `bindgen`->`shlex` | Upstream pins. Was x7; RT-3 took the `hybrid-array` duplicate with `ml-kem`. The crate itself stays (`sha2`/`hkdf` -> `digest` need it). |
| KGP via `buildscript` classpath | `file_picker`, `url_launcher_android` | Upstream. Future Flutter hard error. |

### Next task

_(empty — agree the next one with the maintainer)_

### Faster sync, attempt 2 — this branch

Branched from master 2026-07-28. Documentation only; no code yet.

**Why attempt 1 failed.** `sync_without_second_unlock` is code-complete, never
hardware-tested, and its key-protected path is unreachable by construction. The cause was
process: the assistant applied `net-first` rule 1 (verify the wiring, never trust the
framing) to the code and never to the premise — how a vault comes to exist on a second
device — and never asked. Broken alongside it: terse messages, ask-then-wait, and a
hardware matrix written three times without one being run. **That branch is not to be
merged, and not to be deleted until picked clean.**

**How it works today** (verified 2026-07-28: `rust/src/vault/session.rs:3757`,
`lib/screens/vault_list_screen.dart:1095`):

| Action | What the user must supply |
|---|---|
| `sync from file`, passphrase-only source | the source file's passphrase |
| `sync from file`, key-protected source | the source file's passphrase + PIN + tap |
| `import entries` from another vault | the same, full credentials |

The tap is matched against the **incoming file's** registered keys, never the receiving
vault's — device A's file syncs into device B using one of A's keys. Each device's vault
was created locally, so each holds its own random master key.

**The format is not the problem.** A key-protected save re-seals the body only
(`reseal_vault_body`, `rust/src/crypto/vault_crypto.rs:335`), so the random per-vault master
survives every save, alias change and key add/remove. Two files sharing a master are
provably the same vault — no passphrase, no tap, no Argon2id. A "vault identity" field would
add nothing: two vaults could *claim* to be the same while the body still could not be
opened.

**The missing piece is a flow, not a field.** There is no way to open an existing `.gabbro`
file as a vault on a second device. With one, device B unlocks A's file once, registers its
own keys onto that same master, and every later sync is silent. It cannot live in
`sync from file` — reaching that screen needs an already-open vault with its own master.
Candidates: `onboarding_screen`, `unlock_screen`, manage-vaults. **Unverified: whether such
a flow already exists — check before designing anything.**

**Agreed split:** `sync from file` is the same vault, only ever. `import entries` is any
other source, always full credentials.

**Salvage from attempt 1, in this order:**
1. The net tests — green against unchanged production code, so they apply to master as-is.
2. The Cancel button unreachable at 8x text in the sync-method chooser, and the chooser
   extraction that carried it. Needs its `warnSamePassphrase` parameter stripped.
3. Passphrase-only silent sync, rebuilt without the cached-master branch: the probe collapses
   to one bool and the warning becomes unconditional. Never hardware-tested.
4. The findings below, and the new Bikeshed Code Quality entry.

**Discard — but not yet.** The cached-master silent path and `open_vault_body_with_master`
are dead for independently created vaults, and are exactly what an adoption flow would need.
Keep until that question is settled.

**Findings not to be re-litigated:**
- A passphrase-only save re-seals the whole file (`session.rs:186`, `rust/src/api/vault.rs:1079`)
  with fresh salts. Nothing per-vault survives but the alias, so "it opened" proves only
  *same passphrase* — hence the warning. An entry-UUID-overlap heuristic was **rejected**
  (cries wolf on an empty or fully-replaced vault); do not re-propose it.
- The AES-GCM AAD binds a header to its own body only (`rust/src/vault/file_format.rs:163`).
  Not a cross-file check — the alias comparison is policy, not crypto.
- A YubiKey set that differs per device is expected and must **not** be compared: add/remove
  rewraps the same master. The hmac-secret salt is random per registration
  (`rust/src/fido/device.rs:123`), so a genuinely different vault always needs a tap.
- The credential screen stays the fallback for every case not proven silent.
- Nothing here is done until it runs on hardware with mock vaults.

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Features and UI/UX
- **Final launcher logo (logo-blocked).** `render_icons.sh` renders a placeholder
  SVG. When the real logo lands, replace `assets/images/source/ic_launcher_light.svg`
  and re-run it; same render covers the Windows `.ico` (still the stock Flutter template).
- in `sync` path, we currently have `auto-merge` and `review all changes`, the `auto-merge` is additive only (check and verify) and therefore never deletes items in the receiving vault: (1) add a message that explains this (or the correct) behaviour to the user, (2) add a third `sync` mechanism that simply takes the incoming vault and clobbers the existing one - discuss this

### Code Quality
- **The vault list body overflows at 8x text on a 360dp phone.** A `Column` in
  `vault_list_screen.dart`, ~232-814 px over. The overflow probe sweeps at 2x, which is why
  it never saw this. Related: an `AlertDialog`'s `actions` never scroll, so any button left
  there is unreachable at the maximum text scale — audit every dialog that still puts one
  there. Found during the sync-without-a-second-unlock investigation.

- **Can the auto-type fill error carry secret material to stdout?** `lib/main.dart:478`
  prints the exception text from `autotypeFill`, and `debugPrint` writes in release builds
  too — visible to anyone who launched Gabbro from a terminal. The fill runs in Rust, so the
  error is expected to be something like "window not found", but that is untraced. If it can
  never carry secret material, leave all three auto-type prints (`main.dart:459, 462, 478`)
  as useful diagnostics for a feature that talks to X11; if it can, silence that one in
  release. Answer the question before changing anything.

- **Does a passphrase-only downgrade export mean to drop the vault's name?**
  `build_passphrase_only_bytes` (`rust/src/api/vault.rs:1013`) passes `None` as the alias,
  so the exported copy has no name and opens as an unnamed vault. May be deliberate
  (ADR-013) or an oversight — decide before changing anything. Found during the
  sync-without-a-second-unlock investigation.

### Security (pre-v1)
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit) — **welcome, not blocking** (F-03, the one open design question, is addressed at VERSION 8; this is now defence-in-depth, not a release gate).

### V2+ / Defer
- **Linux biometric unlock** (laptop fingerprint readers, e.g. libfido2/PAM or `fprintd`). Fits the current per-device model unchanged: Linux would just get its own local per-vault secret store; the vault file carries no biometric state, so nothing else changes.
- Passkey provider: store website passkeys (WebAuthn discoverable credentials) in
  the vault so they sync/back up. Distinct from the YubiKey (which unlocks the app);
  tradeoff — website private keys would live in the vault, not in hardware.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Donation/sustainability model: GitHub Sponsors is live; Monero possible later (a large, dedicated effort). Liberapay ruled out (2026-07-22 — Stripe forces business-type onboarding for individuals and has suspended Liberapay-linked accounts; no PayPal). Don't re-propose Liberapay.
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
