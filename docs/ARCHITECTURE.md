# Gabbro Architecture

## Project Overview

A post-quantum password manager built with security as core DNA.
Named after the intrusive igneous rock — hard, stable, enduring.
Cross-platform: Linux (Arch, Mint), Android; Windows later. FOSS, GPL-3.0-only.

**Core principle:** if it touches a secret, it lives in Rust. Everything else lives in Flutter. Secrets never cross the Flutter/Rust bridge in plaintext.

## General Information

**Tech stack:** Flutter (Dart) frontend, Rust backend/crypto, flutter_rust_bridge v2 (FFI).

**Encryption (at rest):** Argon2id KDF → X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange → HKDF-SHA256 combiner → AES-256-GCM. Post-quantum: belt and suspenders.

**Authentication (app access):** Mandatory FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware key (YubiKey). v1 uses Ed25519 (hardware constraint); target ML-DSA-44 once Yubico ships PQ-capable hardware (ADR-005). Min 2 keys (primary + backup), max 4. Auto-lock: 30s default, configurable.

**YubiKey NFC / NDEF OTP:** a YubiKey's OTP slot 1 (an NDEF URI) would open a browser when tapped on Android. Gabbro suppresses this via `NfcConfiguration().skipNdefCheck(true)` and by re-arming foreground dispatch after `stopNfcDiscovery`; OTP slot 1 can stay enabled (no `ykman` workaround). Full diagnosis in LEARNINGS.md.

**Vault file format:** `.gabbro` binary. Plaintext header (magic, version, Argon2id params + salt, HKDF salt, nonce, ML-KEM ciphertext, X25519 ephemeral pubkey) + AES-256-GCM encrypted body (JSON-serialised entries). Self-contained; auth tag detects tampering.

**Vault entries:** 6 types — Login (displayed as "Password" in UI), Note, Identity, Card, File, Custom. Common fields: UUID, created, modified, folder, tags, favourite. No TOTP — YubiKey covers 2FA; keeping them separate is more secure.

**Password generator:** classic (32–256 chars) and passphrase (4–20 words, many languages, EFF-style wordlists embedded at compile time). Classic mode is script-aware (Latin/Greek/Cyrillic pools). All generation in Rust.

**Settings:** `~/.config/gabbro/settings.jsonc` (Linux). JSONC format — human-editable. Theme, text size, high-contrast, alphabet bar position.

**Platforms:** v1: Linux (Arch + Mint/deb), Android (F-Droid + Play Store). Later: Windows.

**Versioning:** SemVer (semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); the current version lives in `pubspec.yaml` (single source of truth). `1.0` is a public trust commitment; don't ship it prematurely. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog 1.0.0.

**Licence:** GPL-3.0-only (ADR-004). Play Store one-time payment is licence-compatible; F-Droid free build coexists without conflict.

**Version control:** private GitHub repo at https://github.com/Zabamund/gabbro. SSH auth. `chat_info/` is git-ignored.

## Features

Shipped features are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Planned and deferred work lives in the Bikeshed at the end of this file.

## Testing

| Suite | Passing | Ignored |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rust (`cargo test -q`) | 514 | 8 |
| Rust vault backward-compat gate (`cargo test --release --test vault_backward_compat`) | 10 | 0 |
| Rust state-machine fuzzer (`cargo test --release --test vault_state_machine_fuzz -- --ignored`) | 1 | 1 (opt-in by default) |
| Flutter (`flutter test`) | 793 | 0 |
| Flutter integration (`flutter drive … -d linux --profile`) | 7 | 0 |
| Android (`./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`) | 26 | 17 |

**Test isolation (non-negotiable):** no test may touch the user's real settings or
vault folders. All config/data directories resolve through `GabbroPaths`
(`lib/app_paths.dart`), and `test/flutter_test_config.dart` roots every `flutter test`
run in a throwaway temp sandbox — so even a test that forgets to isolate itself reads an
empty registry and can never reach a real vault (wherever the user saved it). Mirrors the
`rust/tests/fixtures/` ethos of never operating on real data.

## Current Focus

> Update at the end of each session. First thing to read at the start of the next.

### Next active task

**R-04 — Linux core-dump hardening** (`PR_SET_DUMPABLE(0)` + `RLIMIT_CORE(0)`),
following `AI_SECURITY_AUDIT_REVIEW.md`. Stops a crash from writing a core file
that could contain decrypted vault material.

### Open from the security audit

Full per-finding status and detail live in `AI_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`. Still open:

- **F-03** — X-Wing transcript-binding combiner; gated on a human cryptographer (no verifiable-against-spec answer).
- **F-10** — eTLD+1 autofill matching; post-v1 "Strict FQDN" toggle.

A second-pass review (`AI_SECURITY_AUDIT_REVIEW.md`, 2026-06-11) added findings
**R-01…R-07** (per-finding status lives in that document's remediation table).
**R-02** (Android Auto Backup uploaded the vault to Google Drive) and **R-03**
(automatic `.bak` safety copy + corruption-recovery UX + restore-from-backup-file)
are **fixed** — remaining priorities: **R-04** Linux core-dump hardening, then
R-01/R-05/R-06/R-07.

**UI locales deferred** (RTL layout work required): Hebrew, Arabic.

## Build & Release

Build-environment notes (Android/Kotlin/Java setup, SAF export) and the full
release process (pre-flight gate, build, publish) live in their own document:
[BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md](BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Bikeshed / Backlog

**Procedure:** items sit here until work begins. When picked up, move the item to Current Focus and delete it from here. When done, delete it entirely — the git log is the record.

### Security (pre-v1 gates)
- **F-03 X-Wing combiner** — migrate the hybrid KEM combiner to a transcript-binding (X-Wing-style) construction (`ikm = ml_kem_ss ∥ x25519_ss ∥ ml_kem_ct ∥ x25519_pubkey`). No single verifiable-against-spec answer → genuinely needs a human cryptographer's judgement. Would require VERSION 8.
- Human expert cryptography review of `rust/src/crypto/` (ETH/EPFL academic outreach, RustCrypto maintainers, or formal audit).
- Test on de-Googled Android (GrapheneOS/CalyxOS) before v1 — find a willing community tester, don't buy hardware.
- Pin CI Actions to commit SHAs; add `cargo audit` + `osv-scanner --lockfile pubspec.lock` steps (once CI exists). See Track A Phase 1 audit in `AI_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.

### Features & UX
- Privacy-safe "open existing vault by path" (ADR-012 Option B) — a future relaxation of the
  vault-deletion privacy rules under `show_vault_list` OFF. Dead on Android app-private
  storage, low priority.
- **Autofill match quality (Android) — needs a serious dedicated session.** On-device
  reality (2026-06-09, S23): on most sites autofill offers nothing, on some it fills the
  *wrong* credential ("wrong password"), on very few it works. Three suspects, all now
  pinned by Robolectric tests in `GabbroAutofillServiceRobolectricTest`:
  (1) **field detection** — `ParsedStructure.collectIds` heuristics (autofill hints →
  inputType → hint/idEntry keywords) miss many real login forms, especially SPA/Chromium
  DOM-to-AssistStructure shapes → "offers nothing";
  (2) **domain matching** — `extractRegistrableDomain`'s naive last-two-labels eTLD+1
  (audit **F-10**) collapses e.g. `*.co.uk` to `co.uk`, so unrelated sites can collide →
  "wrong password"; needs the Public Suffix List;
  (3) **native-app matching** — `extractAppToken` + `summary.url.contains(token)` substring
  match is far too loose (e.g. token `paypal` matches any URL containing it) → wrong entry.
  Plan it as: PSL-backed eTLD+1, a real form-field model, and tightened app matching
  (package-name mapping, see the V2+ item). Touches the Android autofill security surface,
  so design-then-implement with on-device verification.
- Autofill silent no-match (unlocked path): decide whether to surface a notification/toast.
- Autofill save requests (`onSaveRequest` — full design in a dedicated session).

### Code Quality
- KGP warning: `file_picker` and `url_launcher_android` apply Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) via the old per-plugin `buildscript` classpath pattern. Flutter warns this will become a hard build error in a future Flutter version. Both plugins are at their latest pub versions — fix must come from upstream. Monitor for `file_picker 12.x` and `url_launcher_android` releases that remove per-plugin KGP application.
- **NumLock toggled off during unlock (Linux).** Something in the vault-unlocking flow appears to toggle NumLock off (observed on Linux). Low-impact annoyance, almost certainly a quick fix once the cause is found — suspect a key-event / focus interaction during the unlock sequence. Investigate and pin with a note in LEARNINGS.md.
- **Wayland/bubblewrap launch env var.** A Debian/Wayland tester had to pass an env var to bubblewrap before the app would boot (separate from, and prior to, the now-fixed tolerant write path). This is a Flutter-on-Wayland / GTK-sandbox launch concern that happens before any Dart runs, so it cannot be fixed in `app_paths.dart`. Pending the tester's report of the exact variable; then document it (and/or detect/handle the sandbox at launch).

### V2+ / Defer
- Passphrase wordlists — not viable without significant pipeline work: `yo` Yoruba (no frequency ordering, complex tonal diacritics); `sr_Latn` Serbian Latin (only Cyrillic corpora; needs transliteration pipeline); `lb` Luxembourgish (small speaker base); `wa` Walloon (nothing usable, French covers Wallonia).
- Autofill via `auto-type` (desktop) — global hotkey → foreground-window detection → synthesised keystrokes into another app (the KeePass/KeePassXC model, no browser extension). Needs a dedicated design session + ADR: Wayland blocks synthetic input outside the freedesktop RemoteDesktop portal / `libei` (KeePassXC's own auto-type is partial there), it's a new secret→input-subsystem security surface, and it cuts across "secrets live in Rust" (Rust holds the secret + synthesises input, Flutter registers the hotkey, per-platform window detection). Desktop-first; shares no code with Android autofill. Discuss-then-plan-or-drop.
- Passkey (WebAuthn discoverable credential) support.
- Vault sync across devices.
- Autofill save requests (`onSaveRequest`) — see also Features & UX above.
- Data breach alerts / HaveIBeenPwned integration.
- Panic button / app hiding on mobile.
- Remote app / vault deletion.
- Custom and hideable filter chips (post-v1 user feedback gate).
- *Broad* cross-layer integration scaffolding beyond the targeted hard-to-reach paths now in Current Focus (e.g. an exhaustive `integration_test/` × Rust `tests/` matrix). YAGNI: if users file bugs, those become the organic integration test suite.
- Windows support.
- Yubico partnership.
- Destination Linux podcast outreach (when approaching public release).
- Donation/sustainability model (GitHub Sponsors + Liberapay + Monero — dedicated session near release).
- No-telemetry verification guide (ripgrep scan, Wireshark, NetGuard).
- Support model (GitHub Issues + SUPPORT.md for v1; revisit when user base exists).
- Import: content-hash deduplication and entry-level merge.
- Native app autofill matching by package name (v2).
